## Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz-Equation

This shiny-app is an interactive version of the Goldman-Hodkin-Katz equation used to calcualte the resting potential across a cell membrane in dependence on the relative permeabilities as well as the inner and outer concentrations of different ion species (potassium, sodium, and chloride).

Make sure that you have R and the following R packages installed on your machine and loaded in your R session:

**shiny** <br/>**shinyWidgets** <br/>**shinyjs** <br/>**ggplot2** <br/>**speg**

    # Install packages from the R-console via:
    install.packages("shiny")
    install.packages("shinyWidgets")
    install.packages("shinyjs")
    install.packages("ggplot2")
    install.packages("jpeg")
    
    # Load packages from the R-console via:
    library(shiny)
    library(shinyWidgets)
    library(shinyjs)
    library(ggplot2)
    library(jpeg)
    
## Using the App locally

Once you have installed and loaded all the libraries, you can start the App from the command line using:

    runGitHub( "Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz", "DaSchmidtke")
    
## Using the App online

An online version of the App that does not need local installation of R and the dependencies can be found here:
